# Cyberpunk Balancing Engine

This is a VS code simulation and data analytics tool I used to balance a new custom gearlist called Cyberpunk Mk2 for the Cyberpunk 2020 TRPG ruleset. It simulates every factor it can, including armour SP, body type modifier, stun checks, critical injuries, and all weapon stats. It can be used to measure viability in a couple different ways, like traditional time to kill (TTK) or percentile chance to instantly kill a given target on the first round of combat.

This tool requires the repository be opened in VS code and ran in an interactive environment to make sure of matplotlib.pyplot. To run it in vscode, right click on code and "run in interactive window." Custom weapon stats can be imported using a format you can copy from the included weapon lists.
