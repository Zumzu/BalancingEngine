# Cyberpunk Balancing Engine

This is a VS code simulation and data analytics tool I used to balance a new custom gearlist called Cyberpunk Mk2 for the Cyberpunk 2020 TRPG ruleset. It simulates every factor it can, including armour SP, body type modifier, stun checks, critical injuries, ammo types, and all weapon stats. This is all done to gather metrics that can be used to measure a given weapon or ammotypes viability in a couple different ways, like traditional time to kill (TTK) or percentile chance to instantly kill a given target on the first round of combat. It can take a bulk list of weapon stats which can be cherry picked against other specific cases, or used entirely to generate a "power curve" for the given metric, allowing you to easily slot in another weapon and have it produce an output power value.

This tool requires the repository be opened in VS code and ran in an interactive environment to make use of matplotlib.pyplot. To run it in vscode, right click on code and 'run in interactive window.' If you want to use the scraping tool that automatically pulls and formats the current online gun and armour list, you also need to install bs4 and lxml. Custom weapon or armour stats still have to be added manually using the format from the included lists.
